# Workflow

We work with three top branches  

* `main` Latest stable release.
* `test` Semi stable testing environment.
* `dev` For development purposes.

The workflow is as follows:
#### 1) Branch of the latest version of `dev`:  
```
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout -b "feature/cool_new_feature"
```
#### 2) Implement and push to feature branch continously. 
```
# The below creates the remote link.
git push --set-upstream origin feature/cool_new_feature
```

#### 3) Create a PR to merge into the dev branch.
##### 3.5) Handle merge conflicts locally if there are any.
```
git checkout feature/cool_new_feature
git merge dev

/// solve the conflicts

git commit -a -m "Solved merge conflicts"
git push
```

*The next steps are required when a feature or set of features should move from dev into testing.*

#### 4) Create a pull request and move dev into testing 
* Perform various tests to ensure the new features are ready for production.

#### 5) If releasing a new version: Create a pull request from testing into main.
##### 5.5) Celebrate that a new stable version have been released.
