\description{
To interact with a {targets} pipeline (e.g., run the pipeline,
load the completed targets from cache into memory), targets needs to know
which pipeline you want to work with. \verb{This function} is a thin wrapper
apound a Sys.setenv() call, and depends on the _targets.yaml file being set
up correctly (this happens automatically when you run use_pipeline() to set
up a new pipeline
}
